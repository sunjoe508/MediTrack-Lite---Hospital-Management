# MediTrack Lite - Hospital Management System

## Overview
MediTrack Lite is a simple hospital management system built using Python and Tkinter. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing patients, doctors, appointments, and medicine records. The system is designed to be lightweight and easy to use for small healthcare facilities.

## Features
- **Register Patients**: Allows users to add patient details such as name, age, and condition.
- **Add Doctors**: Enables the registration of doctors along with their specialties.
- **Schedule Appointments**: (Currently under development)
- **Add Medicine**: (Currently under development)
- **View Records**: Displays registered patients and doctors.
- **Exit Application**: Closes the program safely.

## Requirements
Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. The application requires the `tkinter` module, which is included with most standard Python installations.

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python Meditrack_Lite_Gui.py
   ```

## Error Handling
If the `tkinter` module is missing or not supported in your environment, you may see an error message. Ensure that `tkinter` is installed or try running the application on a system that supports GUI-based Python applications.

## Future Improvements
- Implement appointment scheduling.
- Develop a medicine inventory management system.
- Improve the UI with better styling and layouts.
